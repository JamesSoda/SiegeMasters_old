# SiegeMasters_old

This was the original SiegeMasters plugin for my Minecraft server. I am currently rewriting it as the code slowly grew bloated as I never expected this project to get this far.
The rewrite will include improved database functionality, additional player profile information, better PvP consistency, and many more game improvements.

This plugin uses the Spigot API to add/edit the functionality of Minecraft servers.
Here is some information about Spigot (taken from their Wiki):

SpigotMC.org is home to the community behind the biggest Minecraft server software projects.

Spigot is both a modified Minecraft server and API. The Spigot server adds many improvements to Minecraft's "vanilla" server. The API allows developers to create plugins which add features to the server never before possible with the vanilla server.

The Spigot Server and API use Java.
